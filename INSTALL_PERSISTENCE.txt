To run the application, do as follow:
1. In MariaDB
   a. load the file "persistence/becrafter.sql"
   b. execute the query loaded
2. Create the folder "C:/BeCrafter"
3. Copy the folders "orders" and "recipes" (placed in the folder "persistence") inside "C:/BeCrafter"

At the end the folder must be:
C:/               <- directory
|_ BeCrafter/     <- directory
   |_ orders/     <- directory
   |  |_ X000001  <- file
   |_ recipes/    <- directory
      |_ R001     <- file
      |_ R002     <- file
      |_ R003     <- file

Note: the "persistence" folder is located in the root folder of the project
